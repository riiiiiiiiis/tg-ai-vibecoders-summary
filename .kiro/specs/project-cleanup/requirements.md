# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves conducting a comprehensive review and cleanup of the Telegram Dashboard project to remove unnecessary files, unused dependencies, and outdated documentation while ensuring all remaining code and documentation accurately reflects the current state of the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining this codebase, I want to remove all unnecessary files and dependencies, so that the project is lean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the project structure THEN the system SHALL identify and remove any unused configuration files
2. WHEN examining package.json dependencies THEN the system SHALL remove any packages not actually used in the codebase
3. WHEN checking for test infrastructure THEN the system SHALL remove vitest configuration and references if no tests exist
4. WHEN reviewing documentation references THEN the system SHALL remove mentions of non-existent features or scripts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working on this project, I want accurate and up-to-date documentation, so that I can understand the current state and capabilities of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading the README.md THEN it SHALL accurately reflect only the features and scripts that actually exist
2. WHEN reviewing steering documentation THEN it SHALL match the actual technology stack and project structure
3. WHEN examining package.json scripts THEN they SHALL only include commands that are functional and necessary
4. WHEN checking technology references THEN they SHALL reflect what is actually implemented (e.g., no Tailwind CSS if not used)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer reviewing the codebase, I want consistent and accurate configuration files, so that the development environment works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining configuration files THEN they SHALL only contain settings for technologies actually used
2. WHEN reviewing TypeScript configuration THEN it SHALL be optimized for the current project structure
3. WHEN checking ESLint configuration THEN it SHALL only include rules relevant to the current codebase
4. WHEN validating environment documentation THEN it SHALL accurately describe all required and optional variables
